# [pi-top](https://pi-top.com) - Frontend technical test

## Summary

I've implemented all of these 3 features in this test app:
- **Todo List** - simple list of notes
- **Todo Detail** - detail of a note
- **Todo Creator** - ability to input new notes

Also, this Bonus item is done in my app, and you can edit 'isDone' field as well.

**Bonus:** The user would also be able mark a Todo 'isDone' and have them displayed appropriately. Please code that only if you have extra time.

- Antd design was used for professionally designed components.
- Redux-Saga was used for dealing with Asynchronous state management.

Thanks.
